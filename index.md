## Welcome!
I'm a 5th year **PhD candidate** at the [Center for Applied Mathematics](https://www.cam.cornell.edu/cam), Cornell University. My **research interests** are in numerical analysis and scientific computing with an emphasis on fast numerical linear algebra, approximation theory, and all things eigenvalue-related!

## Education
I have a **dual B.Sc in physics and mathematics** from [Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute](https://www.rpi.edu/) (RPI), where I conducted research in cellular motors (math modeling), nanomaterials (computational physics), and ultrathin films (experimental physics). My interests in math and physics accelerated after high school while working as an R&D technician at [Praxis Technology](https://praxisti.com), a small biomedical firm in Glens Falls, NY.

At Cornell, I work closely with my supervisor, [Alex Townsend](https://pi.math.cornell.edu/~ajt/) in the mathematics department. [David Bindel](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~bindel/) and [Anil Damle](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~damle/) from the computer science department form my research committee. **My CV is available <a href="ajhPHROS.github.io/pdfs/CV3.pdf" target="_blank">here.</a>**

## Research
The spectral properties of infinite-dimensional operators often provide visual and intuitive insights into the behavior of complex interactions. For instance, the stability of a fluid flow, the scattering cross-section of a nucleus, and the influence of decentralized hubs in large networks are intimately connected to the spectral properties of such operators. **I design algorithms that accurately and efficiently extract eigenvalues, eigenfunctions, and spectral measures of differential and integral operators.** The algorithms use a mix of functional analysis and approximation theory to preserve and exploit the structure of the continuous operator, regardless of the underlying discretization used for numerical computation. In practice, this means

- resolving inherently infinite-dimensional phenomenon related to continuous spectrum
- avoiding spectral pollution from the underlying finite-dimensional discretizations
- black-box approaches to a broad class of infinite-dimensional spectral problems
- enhanced flexibility when selecting discretization schemes

**Software implementations** exploiting fast linear algebra are available at [https://github.com/SpecSolve](https://github.com/SpecSolve).
