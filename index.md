I'm an Assistant Professor at [Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI)](https://faculty.rpi.edu/andrew-horning). I work in numerical analysis and scientific computing, with recent interests in

- infinite-dimensional spectral problems
- randomized numerical linear algebra
- data-driven modeling and analysis

Before coming to RPI, I obtained a Ph.D. in Applied Mathematics at Cornell University and worked as an Applied Math Instructor at MIT.

Here is a movie from a recent research project.

The movie shows the evolution of a few coherent observables on the chaotic Lorenz attractor, identified by [Rigged DMD](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00782). Rigged DMD, developed with colleagues [Matthew Colbrook](https://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/user/mjc249/home.html) (thanks to Matt for the beautiful video!) and [Catherine Drysdale](https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/staff/profiles/metabolism-systems/drysdale-catherine), uses data to break down challenging nonlinear dynamical systems into a set of simple coherent patterns.
