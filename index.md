I'm an Assistant Professor at [Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI)](https://faculty.rpi.edu/andrew-horning). I work in numerical analysis and scientific computing, with recent interests in

- infinite-dimensional spectral problems
- randomized numerical linear algebra
- data-driven modeling and analysis

Before coming to RPI, I obtained a Ph.D. in Applied Mathematics at Cornell University and worked as an Applied Math Instructor at MIT.
